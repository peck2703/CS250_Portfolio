#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

When a client shows a need, it is our responsibility to deliver solutions to these needs in a form the clients' choose. When we write and review user stories, it is how we express our customer's idea and create something from it. That user story becomes a template from which a developer can mold it into a piece of software or design element that can be seen from the stakeholder's point of view. This is how we provide value directly to the stakeholders.

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs is a lot like a recipe used in baking. You don't just dive right in without some form of plan or resources. Like the late Anne Burrell always said on her cooking shows, "mise en place," which means everything in its place before you start. Phase one of Agile is planning, but in this case, we don't plan everything, but we plan enough to get a start on things and then add things as we progress. This way, we are able to adapt, or pivot if the client or stakeholder's vision ever changes. This way we can save money and time by not having to redo work, when it can be avoided during the development process.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means a lot of things to many different people. One, you always do your work and never impede others doing their work, being a good team player. Two, you offer up suggestions or opinions that could benefit the process and never discourage others in doing so. Three, infighting does more damage to a team's morale than unfinished work.
